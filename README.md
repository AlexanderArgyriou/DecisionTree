AI C++ Project (Decision Tree).
*	A C++ approach to implement a Decision Tree from scratch using CART(Classifcation And Regression Trees) supervised learning algorithm.
*	The Basic concept behind Decision Trees https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree.
*	Mathematical Description of Gini Impurity and Info Gain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity. 
*	The project aims to predict your choice from a dataset represented as a 2D array in memory.
*	You can make your own datasets as .txt files and train the model with them.
*	Repository contains datasets(Top 100 richest athletes on Forbes, NBA Players from Draft, etc).
