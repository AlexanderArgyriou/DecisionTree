AI C++ Project (Decision Tree).

* A C++ approach to implement a Decision Tree using a smaller and simpler variation of CART algorithm based on user's answers("yes" or "no") to model's questions.
* The Basic concept behind Decision Trees https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree.
* The project aims to predict your choice from a dataset represented as a 2D array in memory.
* You can make your own datasets as .txt files and train the model with them. 
* Repository contains some datasets(NBA players 2015, Top 100 richest athletes on Forbes, etc).
